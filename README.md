We present a large scale urban scene dataset associated with a handy simulator based on Unreal Engine 4 and AirSim, which consists of both man-made and real-world reconstruction scenes in different scales, referred to as *[UrbanScene3D ](https://vcc.tech/UrbanScene3D)*. The manually made scene models have compact structures, which are carefully constructed/designed by professional modelers according to the images and maps of target areas; see the first row of Figure 1 for a glance. In contrast, *UrbanScene3D* also offers dense, detailed scene models reconstructed by aerial images through multi-view stereo (MVS) techniques. These scenes have realistic textures and meticulous structures; see e.g., the second row of Figure 1. We have also released the originally captured aerial images that have been used to reconstruct the 3D scene models, as well as a set of 4K video sequences, all of which would facilitate designing algorithms, such SLAM and MVS; please check some samples shown in the third and fourth rows of Figure 1.

## Requirements

The released zip file contains the unreal project of the above proposed urban scenes. As Video 5 shown, users can use either pure [**Unreal Engine**](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/index.html) or [**AirSim client (both in C++ or python)**](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/apis/) to capture their desired data. The ground truth textured meshes and their relevant poses are also provided in the Unreal project.

â€‹	Required packages:

- Unreal Engine 4 (4.24 is recommended)
- C++ or Python
- AirSim(Optional)
